<br>
`r emo::ji("clock")` From 9 am to 4.30 pm
<br>
`r emo::ji("location")` Nationale Nederlanden, The Hague

Course materials will be posted in the week before the workshop. 

## Overview

<p text-align="justify"> This three-day workshop introduces the *essential concepts of building machine learning models with R*. Throughout the workshop you will gain insights in the foundations of machine learning methods, including *resampling methods*, *data preprocessing steps* and the *tuning of parameters*. You will cover a variety of *statistical and machine learning methods*, ranging from GLMs, over tree-based machine learning methods to neural networks. You will acquire insights in the foundations of these methods, learn how to set-up the model building process, and focus on building a good understanding of the resulting model output and predictions.</p> 

<p align="justify">Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of the working principles of a variety of machine learning methods and be able to explore their use in practical settings. Moreover, you should have acquired the fundamental insights to explore some other methods on your own.</p> 

## Schedule

The detailed schedule follows in the week before the workshop.

| Session | Duration      | Description | Material |
|:-------:|-----------|-------------|------|
| Day 1   | 6.5 hours | ...    | ... |
| Day 2   | 6.5 hours | ... | ... |
| Day 3   | 6.5 hours | ...         | ... |

##### Day 1: Machine learning foundations, regression methods

Topics include: 

- statistical and machine learning: a tour
- machine learning foundations, including resampling with `caret` and `rsample` 
- feature pre-processing steps, including setting up a blue-print with `recipes`
- regression models, including regularization: `lm()`, `glm()`, `mgcv()`, `glmnet()`

##### Day 2: Tree-based machine learning methods

Topics include: 

- decision trees
- ensembles of trees (bagging, random forests, gradient boosting machine, XGboost)
- ML interpretability tools (variable importance, PDP, ICE, and more)
- H2O

##### Day 3: Deep learning methods

Topics include: 

- neural network infrastructure, calibration steps and tuning of (hyper)parameters
- building deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras via the `keras` library in R
- a variety of deep learning algorithms (e.g. CNNs and ANNs)
- putting it all together: case studies
- wrap up.

## Prework

<p align="justify">The workshop requires a basic understanding of R. A good starting level is the material covered in the [1-Basic](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-R/tree/master/1%20-%20Basic%20R) folder of the [Programming in R](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-R) workshop taught at Nationale Nederlanden in June 2019. From time to time you will also rely on concepts taught in the [2-Advanced](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-R/tree/master/2%20-%20Advanced%20R) folder of the same workshop, including `purrr` and some data handling and visualisation tools. This workshop will provide some review of these topics.</p>

Familiarity with statistical or machine learning methods is *not* required. The workshop gradually builds up these concepts, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations and exercises.

## Software Requirements

Please bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed. Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the course material one day before the start of the workshop. You will need:

- R (at least 3.6 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> )
- RStudio ( <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> )

You will now go through three steps: (1) installing packages, (2) installing h2o interface and (3) installing keras interface. The instructions are also stored as an R script in the [scripts](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-ML/tree/master/scripts) folder.  

**Step 1**: run the following script in your R session to install the required packages

```{r packages, eval = FALSE}
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "gridExtra", "AmesHousing", "caret", "rsample", "broom", "recipes", "mgcv", "glmnet", "evtree", "classInt", "rgdal", "RColorBrewer", "ggmap", "grid", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "rpart.utils", "vip", "pdp", "ipred", "ranger", "gbm", "xgboost", "gganimate", "transformr", "zeallot", "sp", "tmap", "partykit", "rattle", "sf", "leaflet", "devtools")
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

# from github
devtools::install_github("henckr/distRforest")
library(distRforest) # from https://github.com/henckr/distRforest

all_packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "purrr", "readr", "tibble", "lubridate", "here", "gridExtra", "AmesHousing", "caret", "rsample", "broom", "recipes", "mgcv", "glmnet", "evtree", "classInt", "rgdal", "RColorBrewer", "ggmap", "grid", "rpart", "RColorBrewer", "ggmap", "grid", "gridExtra", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "rpart.utils", "vip", "pdp", "ipred", "ranger", "gbm", "xgboost", "gganimate", "transformr", "zeallot", "sp", "tmap", "partykit", "rattle", "sf", "leaflet", "devtools", "distRforest")

if(sum(!(all_packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop("Not all required packages are installed!")
} else {
  message("Everything is set up correctly. Now go to the next steps (h2o and keras).")
}
```

**Step 2**: on **Day 2** you will explore the R interface for the 'H2O' Scalable Machine Learning Platform. We recommend the following installation instructions, see <http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-yu/1/index.html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# The following two commands remove any previously installed H2O packages for R.
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }

# Next, we download packages that H2O depends on.
pkgs <- c("RCurl","jsonlite")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
  if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { install.packages(pkg) }
}

# Now we download, install and initialize the H2O package for R.
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos="http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-yu/1/R")
```

Alternatively, you just do

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("h2o")
library(h2o)
```

**Step 3**: on **Day 3** you will be working with the R interface to `keras`. We recommend the installation instructions on <https://keras.rstudio.com/>. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")
library(keras)
install_keras()
```

If the above instructions to get `keras` do **not** work, you can **alternatively** proceed as follows

* download Anaconda at <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>, select the version for Python 3.7 and make sure to pick the right (top of the page: select Windows, macOS or Linux)

* install Anaconda. This is straightforward after launching the installer, but (in case you are in doubt) some instructions are at <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/>

* open an Anaconda Prompt (or terminal for macOS) (e.g. via Start in Windows and search for Anaconda Prompt) and install keras and tensorflow with the following instructions

```{python eval=FALSE}
pip install keras 
pip install tensorflow
```

* install `keras` in R and load the library
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")
library(keras)
```

## Course material

Lecture sheets will become available a week before the workshop (in pdf and HTML format). R scripts, notebooks and the data sets used throughout the course will be at your disposal.
